This datasets include six kinds of data, they are sea surface temperature, air temperature, sea surface salinity, sea surface density, and current velocity in two directions. These physical variables are obtained from high-resolution observations, which can offer important understanding of the physical processes that affect SST variations. 
The study area spans from 5N to 5S in latitude and from 160W to 170W in longitude. The data used have a spatial resolution of 0.05 degree.# multi-factor-datasets
